# Functional Programming in JavaScript

This repository contains the code and resources for the Functional Programming in JavaScript course. The course is designed to introduce you to the principles of functional programming and how to apply them in JavaScript.

## Course Outline

### Introduction to Functional Programming
- What is Functional Programming?
- Key Concepts: Immutability, Pure Functions, Higher-Order Functions


### What is Functional Programming?

- Other paradigms:
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP)
  - Procedural programming
  - Imperative programming
  - Declarative programming

Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as the primary building blocks of software. It is based on the principles of mathematics and logic, and it is characterized by the following key features:



1. **Immutability**: Data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once it is created. Instead, new data is created by combining existing data.
2. **Pure Functions**: Functions that do not have side effects and return a value that depends only on their inputs.
3. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that can take other functions as arguments and return new functions.


### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments and return new functions.
